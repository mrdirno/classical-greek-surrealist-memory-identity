## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where the protagonist discovers a memory that isn't his own, carved into a piece of his uncle's stone collection.
- Create a dialogue between the old keeper and a flickering figure from the wall, debating the ethics of memory erasure.
- Describe a surreal 'marketplace' within the memory-labyrinth where identities are bartered and reshaped like antiquities.
- Write a myth, in the classical Greek style, that explains the origin of the horn mask and its first wearer.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the memory-house, where each room (Andron, courtyard, circular chamber) reveals a fragment of the narrative or a thematic stone when clicked.
- Create a text generator that produces 'surrealist ekphrasis'—descriptions of impossible classical art—inspired by the plinth carving and flickering walls.
